### Sales and purchase support

### Questions and bug reports

Any other requests, questions and bug reports about our open-source Virtualmin GPL, Cloudmin GPL, Webmin, Usermin and Authentic Theme products should generally be brought up in [Virtualmin Community](https://forum.virtualmin.com/) forum. Virtualmin Professional and Cloudmin Professional customers may also request support by sending us a [private ticket](https://forum.virtualmin.com/new-message?groupname=staff&body=%7C++SYSTEM+INFORMATION%7C%7C%0A%7C------------------------------%7C-------------------------------%7C%0A%7C++OS+type+and+version++%7C+++++REQUIRED+++++%7C%0A%7C++Webmin+version+++++++++%7C+++++REQUIRED+++++%7C%0A%7C++Virtualmin+version+++++%7C+++++REQUIRED+++++%7C%0A%7C++Related+packages++++++%7C+++SUGGESTED+++%7C%0A%0A%0A%0A). We try to respond to tickets within 24 hours, seven days a week, including holidays. Please respect that the private ticket support is only for bug reports or queries from our Professional products customers, and we\'ll try to keep the response time in the forums as low as possible so you still get reliable and fast help even for our open-source software (but, all support for our OSS projects is provided on an as-available basis with no guarantee about response time).
