This guide will take you through the steps to change the interface theme in Virtualmin.

### Setting a new theme for all users

If you're the server administrator and wish to update the theme for all users, follow these instructions:

1. **Log in as administrator**  
   Access your Virtualmin panel by logging in as the [Master Administrator](/docs/getting-started/understanding-virtual-server-and-account-types/#master-administrator), typically using the _root_ account credentials.

2. **Navigate to Webmin section**  
   In the top-left corner of your dashboard, click on **Webmin** to access the Webmin module.

3. **Access Webmin Configuration**  
   From the navigation menu on the left, click on **Webmin Configuration** to view various settings related to your Webmin interface.

4. **Select Webmin Themes**  
   Within the Webmin Configuration options, find and click on **Webmin Themes** to proceed to the theme selection.

5. **Change theme**  
   Within the **Change theme** tab, you'll see a dropdown list where you can choose from available themes. The **Authentic Theme** is set as the new default for a modern and responsive design, whereas the **Framed Theme** was the old default.

6. **Apply theme**  
   After picking your desired theme, hit the **Change** button to apply your new selection.

7. **Refresh your browser**  
   To see the theme changes take effect, you may need to refresh your browser window.

### Setting a new theme for the current user

Changing the theme for your own account is a straightforward process:

1. **Log in**  
   Access your Virtualmin panel.

2. **Navigate to Change Language and Theme**  
   Look for the **Change Language and Theme** module. This module allows individual users to customize their language and locale settings and interface theme.

3. **Select your theme**  
   In the **Theme** section of this module, you will find a radio button labeled **Personal choice**. Select this option to reveal a dropdown menu with the available themes. The **Authentic Theme** is set as the new default for a modern and responsive design, whereas the **Framed Theme** was the old default.

4. **Apply your theme**  
   From the dropdown menu, choose the theme you wish to apply to your account. This setting will change the appearance of the Webmin interface only for you and will not affect other users.

5. **Refresh your browser**  
    After selecting your new theme, the change should be immediate. However, if you do not see the change, try refreshing your browser to load the new theme.

This documentation provides a quick and easy guide for individual users to change their Webmin interface theme, offering a more personalized experience while working within Virtualmin.
